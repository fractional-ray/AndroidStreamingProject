# AndroidStreamingProject:

### Objective:
It consists of an Android and a desktop component that allows you to stream music from a pc to an Android device.
Additionally, the Android side acts as a fully functional music player which can play from files stored locally on the device.


(should add how it works and how others can contribute)
